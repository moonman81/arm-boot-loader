## Boot Sequence Overview

The Raspberry Pi boot process is multi-stage and varies slightly by model:

### Stage 1: ROM Boot
- Built-in ROM code initializes the ARM processor.
- Searches for bootcode.bin on the primary boot media (SD card by default).
- Loads and executes bootcode.bin.

### Stage 2: Bootcode.bin Execution
- Initializes SDRAM.
- Loads start.elf from boot media.
- start.elf performs hardware initialization.

### Stage 3: Start.elf Execution
- Parses config.txt for boot configuration.
- Loads the appropriate kernel image (kernel.img for ARM32, kernel8.img for ARM64).
- Applies device tree overlays if specified.

### Stage 4: Kernel Boot
- Kernel takes control and initializes the operating system.

### Boot Media Support
- SD card (all models)
- USB (Pi 3 and later)
- NVMe (Pi 5)
- Network boot (via PXE on supported models)

## Secure Boot

Secure boot is optional and varies by model:

### Raspberry Pi 4 and 5
- Supports secure boot with hardware root of trust.
- Uses OTP (One-Time Programmable) bits for key storage.
- Verifies signatures of bootcode.bin, start.elf, and kernel.

### Enabling Secure Boot
1. Program OTP bits with public key hash.
2. Sign firmware components with private key.
3. Place signed firmware on boot media.

### Limitations
- Not available on Pi 1-3.
- Requires specific firmware versions.

## Firmware Update Mechanisms

Firmware updates are handled via the Raspberry Pi Imager or rpi-update tool.

### rpi-update
- Updates bootloader and firmware.
- Downloads latest from Raspberry Pi repository.
- Requires internet connection.

### Manual Updates
- Download firmware from GitHub (raspberrypi/firmware).
- Copy bootcode.bin, start.elf, etc. to boot partition.

### Secure Updates
- For secure boot enabled devices, updates must be signed.
- Use official tools to maintain chain of trust.

## Troubleshooting Boot Failures

### Common Issues
- No boot media detected: Check SD card insertion, format (FAT32).
- Kernel panic: Check kernel image compatibility.
- Secure boot failures: Verify signatures and OTP programming.

### Diagnostic Steps
1. Check LED patterns (refer to Raspberry Pi documentation).
2. Use serial console for boot logs.
3. Verify config.txt syntax.
4. Test with known good firmware.

### Tools
- Raspberry Pi Imager for flashing.
- raspi-config for configuration.
- dmesg for kernel logs.
